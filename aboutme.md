My name is Armita, and I created Lotus Path Wellness from a deep love for energy healing and a belief that true wellness comes from nurturing the mind, body, and spirit together. My path into this work has been guided by curiosity, compassion, and a desire to support others in reconnecting with their inner balance.

Currently, I offer Reiki energy healing, providing calm, grounding support tailored to your unique energy and intention. This space will continue to grow as I deepen my learning and expand my offerings.

I'm so glad you're here.

## What Reiki Is & Who It Helps

Reiki is a gentle energy practice that helps your body, mind, and spirit come back into balance. During a session, universal life energy flows through me to support your natural healing, helping your nervous system relax, tension melt away, and your energy naturally realign. Many people feel a deep sense of calm, warmth, or clarity—even after just one session.

Reiki can be especially helpful if you're:

- Feeling overwhelmed or emotionally heavy
- Struggling to sleep or rest
- Experiencing stress or burnout
- Feeling disconnected from yourself
- Seeking gentle support to nurture your overall wellness

Whether you're new to energy healing or have experienced it before, Reiki meets you where you are and supports you in reconnecting with your natural sense of calm and balance.
