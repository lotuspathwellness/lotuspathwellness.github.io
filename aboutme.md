My name is Armita Khosravi, and I founded Lotus Path Wellness out of a profound reverence for energy healing. I believe that true vitality isn't found in a single fix, but in the gentle nurturing of the mind, body, and spirit as one interconnected whole. I am so glad you have found your way here.

My journey into this work has been a path of curiosity and compassion—a quiet calling to help others navigate their way back to their own inner sanctuary. Currently, I specialize in Reiki energy healing, providing the calm, grounding support needed to clear the 'winter fog' and rediscover your natural balance.

Whether we connect in person or through a distance session, I am honored to support you in this chapter of your healing journey.

## What is Reiki

Reiki is more than a technique; it is a gentle invitation for your system to return to its original state of harmony. By acting as a channel for universal life energy—flowing through my hands to your body's energetic field—I support your natural ability to restore and heal itself.

During our time together, the nervous system begins to settle, physical and emotional tension melts away, and your energy naturally realigns.

Clients often describe a session as a deep 'unwinding'—experiencing warmth, clarity, and a renewed sense of peace that lingers long after the session ends.

## Who This Supports

Reiki meets you exactly where you are. It is particularly supportive if you find yourself:

- **Navigating the Heavy:** Feeling overwhelmed or emotionally weighed down.
- **Searching for Rest:** Struggling with sleep or the inability to truly 'switch off'.
- **Recovering from Burnout:** Restoring energy after periods of intense stress.
- **Seeking Connection:** Feeling a quiet disconnect from your body or intuition.
- **Prioritizing Wellness:** Simply looking for a gentle, non-invasive way to maintain your inner glow.
