## In-Person Reiki Sessions

**Healing, delivered to your sanctuary or received in mine.**

You have the choice of two ways to experience in-person Reiki:

### Mobile Reiki — The Sanctuary Comes to You

Receive a private Reiki session in the comfort of your own home. I provide a portable massage chair and arrive approximately 10 minutes early to set up and connect. The healing session lasts 45 minutes, so please plan for about an hour total.

### In-Home Reiki — A Sacred Space to Receive

Step away from daily life and receive your session in my home in Coquitlam, sitting comfortably in a massage chair within a space energetically prepared for deep rest, uninterrupted stillness, and alignment.

Each session is intuitively guided by your unique needs, offering warmth, peace, and deep relaxation as we restore balance to your mind, body, and spirit.

All that's required is your openness to receive, allowing the energy to support your well-being.

## Distance Reiki Session

**Your sanctuary, your healing—anywhere you are.**

Receive Reiki in the comfort of your own space, no matter the distance. Each session is intuitively scheduled with intention, and we'll connect beforehand to set your personal focus. As the healing energy flows, you may feel deep peace, warmth, or calm—each experience unfolding uniquely for you.

All that's needed is your openness to receive and allow the energy to support your balance and well-being.

## Investment

### Single Reiki Session

**45 minutes — $77**

A dedicated space for deep relaxation, energetic balance, and immediate restoration.

### Three-Session Healing Journey

**Three 45-minute sessions — $210** ($70 per session)

Designed for those ready to experience meaningful shifts, this journey allows your nervous system and energy field the consistency needed for deeper integration and lasting alignment.

### Begin Your Journey

Most clients choose the three-session journey for the depth and continuity it provides.

To reserve your journey, you may begin at the preferred rate of $70 per session starting with your first booking, or complete the full $210 investment at your initial session.

Your first appointment will be reserved now, and we will thoughtfully schedule the remaining two sessions in alignment with your healing rhythm as intuitively guided.

Whichever path you choose, you will receive the same devoted presence, intention, and care.
