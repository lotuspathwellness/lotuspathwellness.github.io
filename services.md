## In-Person Reiki Session

Receive Reiki in the comfort of your own space, using a massage chair I bring to you. Each session is guided with intention, supporting your unique needs and intentions. You may feel warmth, peace, or deep relaxation as the healing energy helps restore balance to your mind, body, and spirit. All that's needed is your openness to receive and allow the energy to support your well-being.

## Distance Reiki Session

Receive Reiki wherever you are, in the comfort of your own space. Each session is intuitively scheduled with intention, and we'll connect beforehand to set your personal intentions. As the healing energy flows, you may feel deep peace, warmth, or calm—each experience unfolding uniquely for you. All that's needed is your openness to receive and allow the energy to support your balance and well-being.
