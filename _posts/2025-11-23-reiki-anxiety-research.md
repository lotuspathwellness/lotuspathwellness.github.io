For those who wonder whether Reiki has scientific backing, a comprehensive 2024 meta-analysis published in *BMC Palliative Care* offers compelling evidence. This rigorous study examined 13 randomized controlled trials involving 824 adult participants, revealing that Reiki therapy significantly reduces anxiety.

## The Study at a Glance

**Published:** June 13, 2024  
**Authors:** Xiulan Guo, Yue Long, Zhikai Qin, Yongtao Fan  
**Journal:** BMC Palliative Care  
**Participants:** 824 adults across 13 studies  

The researchers conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials published between 2005 and 2023, searching major databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library.

## Key Findings

The meta-analysis revealed a **significant anxiety reduction** with Reiki therapy, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.82 (95% CI -1.29 to -0.36, p = 0.001). This statistical result demonstrates a substantial therapeutic effect.

### What Works Best?

The research identified optimal treatment approaches:

- **Short-term interventions** (≤3 sessions) showed strong effectiveness
- **Moderate frequency treatments** (6-8 sessions) produced excellent results
- Particularly beneficial for patients with **chronic conditions**

## Clinical Applications

The study found Reiki especially helpful for individuals experiencing:

- **Health-related anxiety** in patients with chronic conditions
- **Procedural anxiety** before medical procedures like gastrointestinal endoscopy
- Anxiety associated with **fibromyalgia** and **depression**
- General anxiety across various adult populations

## Why This Matters

This meta-analysis is significant because it combines data from multiple independent studies, providing a more robust and reliable conclusion than any single trial could offer. With 824 total participants and rigorous statistical analysis, the evidence strongly supports Reiki as an effective complementary therapy for anxiety reduction.

## The Bottom Line

Science continues to validate what Reiki practitioners and recipients have long known: Reiki can be a powerful tool for managing anxiety. Whether you're dealing with chronic health conditions, facing medical procedures, or simply seeking relief from everyday stress, Reiki offers a gentle, non-invasive approach supported by peer-reviewed research.

The study's conclusion emphasizes that "short-term interventions (≤ 3 sessions) and moderate-frequency Reiki therapy (6–8 sessions) can effectively reduce health and procedural anxiety" across various patient groups.

## Interested in Experiencing These Benefits?

If you're curious about how Reiki might help with your own anxiety or stress, research suggests that even just a few sessions can make a meaningful difference.
