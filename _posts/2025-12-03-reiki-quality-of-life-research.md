## The Study at a Glance

**Published:** March 27, 2025  
**Authors:** Kuiliang Liu, Zhikai Qin, Yizhen Qin, and colleagues  
**Journal:** Systematic Reviews  
**Participants:** 661 individuals aged 14 and above across 11 studies  

The researchers conducted a systematic review searching five major scientific databases, focusing specifically on Reiki therapy's impact on overall quality of life.

## Key Findings

The meta-analysis revealed a **significant enhancement in quality of life** following Reiki therapy, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.28 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.56, p = 0.043). This statistically significant result confirms that Reiki has a measurable positive effect on well-being.

### Optimal Treatment Approaches

The research identified the most effective intervention parameters:

- **Frequency:** ≥ 8 therapy sessions showed optimal results
- **Duration:** Sessions of ≥ 60 minutes were most beneficial
- **Quick relief:** Acute interventions of ≤ 20 minutes also demonstrated effectiveness

## Who Benefits Most?

The study found Reiki particularly helpful for:

- **Surgical patients** during recovery
- **Chronic illness patients** managing ongoing conditions
- **General population** seeking enhanced well-being

## What is "Quality of Life"?

Quality of life encompasses physical health, psychological well-being, social relationships, and overall life satisfaction. Unlike studies that focus on a single symptom, this research looked at the broader picture of how Reiki affects a person's entire sense of well-being.

## Why This Matters

This 2025 meta-analysis is particularly significant because:

1. **It's current** - Published just this year, it represents the latest scientific understanding
2. **It's comprehensive** - Combining 11 studies provides more reliable conclusions than individual trials
3. **It focuses on holistic outcomes** - Rather than just symptom relief, it measures overall life quality
4. **It includes diverse populations** - From cancer patients to the general public

## The Bottom Line

The researchers concluded that "Reiki therapy positively impacted quality of life" and can serve as an effective complementary therapy to enhance overall well-being. Whether you're navigating a health challenge or simply seeking greater balance in your life, this research suggests Reiki offers real, measurable benefits.

## Ready to Improve Your Quality of Life?

If you're interested in experiencing how Reiki might enhance your well-being, the research suggests that consistent sessions of adequate length provide the best results.
