If you're considering your first Reiki session, you might be wondering what to expect. Perhaps you've heard about Reiki from a friend, read about its benefits, or simply feel drawn to try something new for your well-being. Whatever brought you here, this guide will help you feel prepared and at ease.

The truth is, there's very little you need to "do" to prepare for Reiki. But understanding what happens during a session can help you relax and receive the full benefits of this gentle healing practice.

## What is Reiki?

Reiki is a gentle energy healing practice that supports your body's natural ability to heal and rebalance. During a session, universal life energy flows through the practitioner's hands to your body's energetic field, helping your nervous system relax, tension release, and your energy naturally realign.

There's nothing you need to believe or do for Reiki to work—simply being open to receiving is enough.

## What to Expect During Your Session

### Before We Begin

Whether you're receiving Reiki in your home, in my home in Coquitlam, or through a distance session, we'll start with a brief conversation. This is your opportunity to share:

- How you're feeling that day
- Any areas of tension, discomfort, or focus
- Your intentions for the session (if you have any)

There's no pressure to have specific goals. Many people simply come seeking relaxation or a sense of balance, and that's perfectly valid.

### During the Session

For in-person sessions, you'll remain fully clothed and sit comfortably in a massage chair. I'll place my hands lightly on or near various areas of your body, typically starting at the head and moving down through the body.

For distance sessions, you'll find a comfortable spot in your own space—lying down or seated—while I send Reiki energy remotely. We'll connect briefly beforehand, and then you simply rest and receive.

### What You Might Feel

Everyone's experience is unique. During a session, you might notice:

- **Warmth or tingling** in certain areas of your body
- **Deep relaxation**—some people drift into a peaceful, meditative state
- **Emotional release**—sometimes emotions surface gently as energy shifts
- **Subtle sensations** like gentle waves or floating
- **Nothing dramatic**—and that's completely normal too

There's no "right" way to experience Reiki. Whatever arises is simply your body's natural response to receiving healing energy.

### After the Session

Following your session, you may feel deeply relaxed, peaceful, or gently energized. Some people describe a sense of clarity or lightness. Occasionally, you might feel tired as your body continues to process and integrate the healing.

We'll take a few moments to check in, and I'll offer any insights that came through during our time together.

## How to Prepare

The beauty of Reiki is that it requires very little preparation. However, these simple steps can help you get the most from your session:

### The Day Before

- **Stay hydrated**—drink plenty of water
- **Get adequate rest** if possible
- **Set a gentle intention** if one comes to you naturally

### The Day Of

- **Wear comfortable clothing**—loose, breathable fabrics are ideal
- **Eat lightly**—avoid heavy meals right before your session
- **Limit caffeine and alcohol**—these can affect your energy
- **Arrive with an open mind**—release expectations and simply be curious

### For Distance Sessions

- **Create a comfortable space**—somewhere you can lie down or sit undisturbed
- **Silence your phone** and minimize distractions
- **Have a blanket nearby**—your body temperature may drop as you relax
- **Keep water close** for afterward

## After Your Session

To support the integration of your Reiki experience:

- **Drink plenty of water** to help your body process
- **Rest if you feel called to**—honor what your body needs
- **Avoid intense activities** for a few hours if possible
- **Journal your experience** if that resonates with you
- **Be gentle with yourself**—healing continues after the session ends

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to believe in Reiki for it to work?

No. Reiki doesn't require any particular belief system. All that's needed is your openness to receive. Many people who approach Reiki with skepticism still experience deep relaxation and other benefits.

### Is Reiki safe?

Yes. Reiki is a gentle, non-invasive practice with no known negative side effects. It's safe for people of all ages, including pregnant women and those with health conditions. It complements medical treatment but doesn't replace professional healthcare.

### What should I wear?

Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing. You'll remain fully clothed throughout the session. Avoid tight waistbands or restrictive items that might distract you from relaxing.

### How will I feel afterward?

Most people feel deeply relaxed, peaceful, or gently refreshed. Some feel energized, while others feel like resting. Occasionally, people experience mild emotional release or temporary fatigue as energy shifts. All of these responses are normal.

### How many sessions do I need?

This varies by person and intention. Some people find benefit from a single session, while others prefer ongoing support. Many clients choose a three-session journey, which allows the nervous system and energy field the consistency needed for deeper integration.

### Can I receive Reiki if I'm on medication or have a health condition?

Yes. Reiki is complementary to all medical treatments and therapies. It supports your body's natural healing processes without interfering with medications or treatments. Always continue following your healthcare provider's recommendations.

### What's the difference between in-person and distance Reiki?

The energy works the same way regardless of physical proximity. In-person sessions offer the comfort of physical presence, while distance sessions allow you to receive from wherever you are. Many people find distance sessions equally powerful and appreciate the convenience.

### What if I fall asleep?

That's perfectly fine—and quite common. Falling asleep simply means your body has dropped into a deep state of relaxation. The Reiki continues to work regardless of whether you're awake.

### What if I don't feel anything?

Some people have subtle experiences, especially during their first session. Not feeling dramatic sensations doesn't mean nothing is happening. The benefits of Reiki often reveal themselves in the hours and days following a session—better sleep, decreased stress, or a general sense of well-being.

## Your First Step

There's no perfect time to begin your healing journey. If you're feeling called to try Reiki, trust that instinct. Whether you're navigating stress, seeking relaxation, or simply curious about energy healing, Reiki meets you exactly where you are.

All that's required is your openness to receive.
