Reiki is a Japanese energy healing technique that promotes relaxation, reduces stress, and supports the body's natural ability to heal. The word "Reiki" comes from two Japanese words: *Rei* (universal) and *Ki* (life energy).

## How Does Reiki Work?

During a Reiki session, the practitioner places their hands lightly on or just above the client's body. Energy flows through the practitioner's hands to the recipient, helping to balance the body's energy centers, known as chakras.

Reiki is based on the principle that when our life force energy is low or blocked, we are more likely to feel stressed or unwell. When it flows freely, we experience greater health and happiness.

## Benefits of Reiki

Many people experience profound benefits from regular Reiki sessions:

- Deep relaxation and stress relief
- Reduced anxiety and improved mood
- Better sleep quality
- Pain management support
- Enhanced emotional clarity
- Accelerated healing after illness or surgery
- Greater sense of peace and well-being

## What to Expect in a Session

A typical Reiki session lasts 60-90 minutes. You remain fully clothed and lie comfortably on a massage table. The practitioner gently places their hands in various positions, allowing healing energy to flow.

Many clients report feeling warmth, tingling, or a sense of deep peace during the session. Some even fall asleep, which is perfectly normal and welcomed.

## Is Reiki Right for You?

Reiki is a gentle, non-invasive practice suitable for people of all ages and health conditions. It complements conventional medical treatments and other holistic therapies beautifully.

Whether you're seeking relief from stress, support during a health challenge, or simply a deeper connection to your own well-being, Reiki offers a gentle path to healing.
