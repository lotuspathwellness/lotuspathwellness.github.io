## The Basics: Understanding Reiki

**What is Reiki, really?**  
Think of it as a gentle tune-up for your body's internal battery. Scientifically, it interacts with your biofield to move your nervous system from "fight or flight" into "rest and digest," clearing mental fog and lowering stress.

**Do I need to believe in it for it to work?**  
Not at all! Reiki functions like a "reset button" for your nervous system. Much like a nap refreshes you whether you "believe" in sleep or not, Reiki works by giving your body the quiet space it needs to recover.

**Is it the practitioner's personal energy?**  
No. I act as a "conduit" or a lamp cord—I am not the electricity; I simply allow the universal energy to reach the bulb. You receive a clean recharge from the source, not my personal energy.

**In-person or distance?**  
Both! I offer in-person sessions in a comfy massage chair at your home, or distance sessions globally. Much like Wi-Fi carries a signal without wires, Reiki can be shared anywhere to help you feel centered.

## Safety & Peace of Mind

**Is Reiki safe?**  
Absolutely. It is non-invasive, gentle, and involves no chemicals or physical manipulation. It is safe for all ages and works in harmony with any traditional medical treatments.

**Can emotions or "bad vibes" transfer to me?**  
No. Reiki is "smart" energy. I act as a neutral bridge, so my personal thoughts or moods stay with me. You are in a safe, protected bubble where only the restorative energy you need can enter.

**What should I wear?**  
Comfort is key! You remain fully clothed. Wear whatever makes you feel at ease—like cozy socks, yoga pants, or your favourite t-shirt.

## The Experience & Results

**What will I feel?**  
Every nervous system is different. You might feel warmth, tingling, a cool breeze, or an emotional release. Many people drift into a deep, restorative sleep. Subtle or vivid—it's all working!

**What if I don't feel anything?**  
Don't worry, the "recharge" is still happening. Just like a phone on a wireless charging pad, the battery fills up even if you don't feel the electricity moving.

**How should I feel afterward?**  
Most people feel "lighter," grounded, and mentally clear. Think of it as that peaceful "after-yoga" glow.

**How many sessions do I need?**  
There is no one-size-fits-all. A single session is a great "reset," while regular visits help maintain a baseline of peace. Trust your body to tell you when you need a boost.

## Supporting Your Glow: Post-Session Care

To get the most out of your "integration period," follow these simple steps:

💧 **Hydrate:** Water helps flush your system and grounds your energy. Drink an extra glass or two!

🍃 **Honor Your Pace:** You may feel "zen" or sleepy. Avoid high-stress tasks and give yourself permission to move a little slower today.

🍎 **Eat Something Grounding:** If you feel "floaty," a small snack (like nuts or warm tea) will help bring you back down to earth.

📝 **Notice the Shifts:** Over the next 48 hours, look for subtle changes like better sleep or a quieter mind.
